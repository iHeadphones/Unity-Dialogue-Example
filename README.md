# Unity-Dialogue-Example
Branching dialogue system for use with Unity Engine. Features a basic GUI for player to select from multiple options, a branching system where player dialogue options can lead to different NPC responses configured by the user, and a system to optionally track events so NPCs can respond to previous quests or player choices, allowing for dynamic dialogue. Ideal for text-heavy games such as RPGs

There are still changes planned for this so it is not completely ready for production yet.

Note: It has come to my attention that cloning the repo and attempting to run it in Unity is not working. If this is the case for you I would recommend just saving the scripts and experimenting with them in your own Scene.
